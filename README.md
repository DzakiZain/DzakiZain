Hello,

My name is Ahmad Dzaki Zain. I am a programmer/software developer who focuses on creating and developing websites.
I have very good skills in building a website, and I have also created several websites for some of my premium / professional clients.
I am very familiar with PHP, HTML5, CSS, Javascript, Codeigniter, Laravel, Bootstrap, C # Programing, and MySQL. I am very interested in the project you are offering.
I will give satisfactory performance and give the best results for you. You can see my portfolio at http://batique.ga/?i=1 for consideration in recruiting me.
That is the offer from me, and if you feel very suitable and want to know more about me, you can contact me and have a discussion via the chat feature on this web.
I am very happy if I get the opportunity to work with you through the project. Thanks.
